I have known Dragos for over two years, during which time he worked as a full-stack software developer in my team. From day one, during the time that he has worked in our company, Dragos impressed us with his willingness to learn and his capacity to understand new concepts. Also, he has a work rate that I have rarely seen at other developers. He has quickly established himself as a reliable programmer, writing good quality code and supporting the team whenever needed. He is both very bright and quite motivated. I am confident that he will quickly become an indispensable asset of any software development team. Dragos often surprised everyone with out-of-the box ideas or solutions to different problems. I particularly appreciate his willingness to take initiative to help the team achieve it's goals and deliver on time.",
